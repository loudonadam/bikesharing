## Summary
Our results show that there is heavy, short trip usage during commuter hours. Additionally, weekends see lighter, but significant usage during the afternoons and throughout the day.

- We need to ensure that bikes are predominately deposited at the heaviest use regions at the beginning of the day.
- Extra care should be taken on weekends to ensure that visitors who may be using the bikes for tourism on the weekends do not move the bikes from important commuter areas. So Sunday evenings and Monday mornings will require a concerted effort to return the bikes to their intended starting positions for the work week.
